Installation instructions for graphical visualisation utility GMAP
==================================================================

Unzip the archive (gmap.tar.gz) to a directory of your choice.
This creates a subdirectory there called gmap.
NOTE: this will remain the permanent home of GMAP following
installation.

	gunzip gmap.tar.gz
	tar -xvf gmap.tar

Enter the gmap directory:

	cd gmap

and build the executable:

	make

If the build is successful, the executable 'gmap' should now be
present in the gmap directory.

If you wish you may clean up unneeded build files by typing:

	make clean

To install gmap so that it is found within your default path,
log in as root (superuser) and type:

	make install

(If you do not have permission to log in as root on your system,
you may instead add the path to the gmap directory to your
default path as specified in the '.bashrc' file in your home
directory. For example, if you have placed gmap in a directory
called mysoftware under your home directory, you might add the
following line to .bashrc:

	export PATH=~/mysoftware/gmap:$PATH

First time you will have to reinitialise the cell by typing:

	source ~/.bashrc

End of parenthesis).
